This motor controller monitor receives commands over a serial port.


It monitors voltage, current, temperature and fault pins, and
outputs PWM to command an ESC.

The ESC may need to be reprogrammed to have forward and reverse,
and brushed or brushless.


Based on arduino nano.  The efuse byte should be set to enable the
brown-out detector (BOD) not enabled by default.  This is critical
to ensure flash pages are not corrupted.

To enable, with one arduino programmed with arduinoisp
Read:
avrdude -c avrisp -b 19200 -P /dev/ttyUSB1 -u -p m328 -U efuse:r:-:h
Write:
avrdude -c avrisp -b 19200 -P /dev/ttyUSB1 -u -p m328p -U efuse:w:0x4:m



If the ESC has the bootloader loaded:
   The ESC can be programmed over the 1 wire interface.
   The arduino script ArduinoUSBLinker must be loaded to the arduino.
   The ESC can be programmed from the makefile commands in the brushed_tgy repository.
   Once the ESC is programmed, the arduino can be reprogrammed back to motor.ino

Without bootloader (requires soldering, or special tool)
   arduinoisp script loaded to additional arduino.
   The ESC can install the bootloader this way.
   This arduino must be connected to the esc:
   SCK MISO MOSI 5v GND - connected between both arduinos
   RESET (esc) <-> D10 (arduino) connected
